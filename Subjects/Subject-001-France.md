# SUBJECT REPORT: 001-FRANCE

**STATUS:** ACTIVE / UNCONTAINED
**THREAT LEVEL:** CLASS-IV (SPECTRAL INSTABILITY)
**FIRST RECORDED:** 1994, Limoges, France

## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-001-France, colloquially known as "The Echoing Nursery," is a non-localized haunting phenomenon currently manifesting in abandoned residential structures across central France. 

Unlike static hauntings, Subject-001 is a **temporal loop artifact**. It consists of a high-frequency auditory loop of a music box playing a distorted version of "Au Clair de la Lune," accompanied by the visual manifestation of a juvenile entity (approx. 5 years old) sitting in the center of the room.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **Acoustic Entrapment:** Any person entering the manifestation zone (approx. 5-meter radius) reports an inability to hear external sounds. Only the music box remains audible, increasing in volume until the subject exits the area.
* **Visual Distortion:** Observations through digital cameras show the entity flickering at a rate of 14Hz, consistent with 20th-century film projection speeds.
* **Physical Interaction:** Any attempt to touch the entity results in immediate "cold-burn" cellular damage to the observer.

## 3. CHRONOLOGY
- **1994-05-12:** First reported in an abandoned farmhouse. Local police found three hikers in a catatonic state.
- **2005-09-30:** Manifestation occurred in a modern apartment complex in Lyon. The building was later condemned by the Bureau.
- **2013-Present:** The frequency of appearances has increased by 15%.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
Direct containment is currently impossible due to the spectral nature of the subject. 
* **Step 1:** Establish a 50-meter perimeter around the manifestation site.
* **Step 2:** Deploy low-frequency radio jammers to neutralize the auditory loop.
* **Step 3:** Use Class-C Amnestics on any civilian witnesses.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *Do not listen to the melody for more than 4 minutes. The psychological "echo" effect has led to three cases of permanent auditory hallucinations among field agents.*
