# BUREAU FIELD GUIDE: EQUIPMENT & DETECTION

**DOCUMENT TYPE:** TECHNICAL MANUAL / ADVISORY
**VERSION:** 2013.4
**CLEARANCE:** ALL FIELD AGENTS

## 1. THE "GHOST HUNTER" SCAM
The Bureau warns all initiates against purchasing "Ghost Hunting Kits" from major online retailers (Amazon, eBay, etc.). Most "EMF Meters" with flashing LEDs or "Spirit Boxes" sold for $200 are simply cheap toys with pre-programmed sound banks or unshielded circuits that react to your own smartphone.

To catch a real manifestation, you need **industrial-grade** or **modified analog** equipment.

## 2. RECOMMENDED GEAR (REAL-WORLD ANALOGS)

### A. The Radio (The "Sweep" Method)
Do not buy a "Spirit Box". Instead, find a high-quality **Analog AM/FM Radio** (like a vintage *Sangean* or *Sony* from the 90s).
* **Modification:** Disable the "Mute on Tuning" function.
* **Usage:** By manually sweeping the dial between stations, you create a carrier wave of white noise. Real entities (Class-III and above) manipulate existing radio frequencies to form speech (EVP).

### B. Thermal Detection
Forget "Infrared Thermometers" (the laser pens). They only measure surface temperature.
* **Recommendation:** Use a **FLIR Thermal Imaging Camera**. 
* **Why:** You are looking for "Cold Spots" in the air, not on the wall. A real haunting is an endothermic reaction; it sucks the heat out of the room to manifest.

### C. Electromagnetic Field (EMF)
Cheap meters react to microwaves and cell towers. 
* **Recommendation:** Use a **TriField TF2** or a **k-II Meter** (original, not the Chinese clones).
* **The Test:** If the meter spikes and there is no electrical wiring or fuse box nearby, you are dealing with a localized magnetic distortion.

### D. Audio Recording (EVP)
Smartphone apps are useless because they apply "Noise Cancellation" which deletes the very frequencies ghosts use.
* **Recommendation:** A **Zoom H1n** or a **Tascam DR-05** digital recorder.
* **Setting:** Always record in **WAV (96kHz/24-bit)**. Never MP3. You need the raw data.

## 3. PRO-TIPS FOR REALISTIC INVESTIGATION
1.  **Debunk First:** 90% of "hauntings" are caused by high EMF from old wiring (causing hallucinations), carbon monoxide leaks, or infrasound from old pipes.
2.  **The "Dust" Rule:** If you see "Orbs" on a camera with a flash, it is **dust**. The Bureau does not recognize orbs as evidence.
3.  **Baseline:** Always take 30 minutes of readings *before* you start the investigation to know what "normal" looks like.

## 4. SHOPPING ADVICE
Instead of "Paranormal Stores," shop at:
* **Pawn Shops:** For old analog tech.
* **Industrial Supply Stores:** For thermometers and gas detectors.
* **Music Stores:** For high-end microphones and recorders.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *The best tool is your own body. If the hair on your neck stands up, your brain has detected a frequency shift before your gear has. Trust your instincts, but verify with data.*
