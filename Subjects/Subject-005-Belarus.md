# SUBJECT REPORT: 005-BELARUS

**STATUS:** ACTIVE / CLOSED LOOP
**THREAT LEVEL:** CLASS-VII (ENTROPIC TRAP)
**FIRST RECORDED:** 1976, [LOCATION REDACTED], Belarus

---

## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-005-Belarus, designated as "Village-404," is an isolated residential district consisting of forty-two identical five-story Soviet-era apartment blocks. 

The anomaly is triggered by a **Point of No Return (PNR)**: once a human foot crosses the invisible perimeter of the village square, all paths leading outward redirect the subject back to the center of the complex. No physical or electronic means have successfully breached this loop.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **The Infinite Interior:** While the buildings appear abandoned, entering any apartment leads to a layout that does not match the exterior dimensions. Some hallways extend for kilometers, filled with the smell of old wallpaper and boiled cabbage.
* **The "Grey Residents" (Spectral Entities):** These are translucent, desaturated figures seen wandering the balconies or sitting in dark kitchens. They are former victims who have lost their "vibrancy." They are not directly hostile but will attempt to hold a subject's hand; anyone touched begins to lose their physical opacity within hours.
* **A-Temporal State:** There is no day/night cycle in Village-404. The sky remains a constant, bruised shade of twilight (approx. 5:30 PM atmosphere).

## 3. OBSERVATION LOG
- **1976-08-12:** An entire bus of factory workers disappeared near the site. Aerial reconnaissance showed the bus parked in the village square, empty.
- **1992-04-03:** A Bureau drone equipped with a 5km tether was sent in. At the 500-meter mark, the tether didn't snap but began to "loop," eventually exiting from a window behind the drone operators.
- **2013-10-30:** High-frequency audio capture picked up a collective humming sound coming from the concrete walls of every building, resembling a slowed-down Soviet anthem.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
The area is surrounded by a 10km "Dead Zone" monitored by the Belarusian military under Bureau supervision.
* **Warning Signs:** Signs indicating "HIGH CHEMICAL TOXICITY" are posted to deter locals.
* **Extraction:** There is currently no known method of extraction. If a Bureau agent accidentally triggers the PNR, they are to be considered "MIA" (Missing In Action). 
* **Observation:** Long-range telescopes monitor the "Grey Residents" to track if the village perimeter is expanding.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *There is no record of this village in any Soviet census. It wasn't built and then haunted; it appears the haunting manifested the architecture itself. If you see a light on in a window, do not wave. It's looking for a reason to let you in.*
