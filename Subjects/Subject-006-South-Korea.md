## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-006-South-Korea refers to the remnants and spectral echoes of the **"Cheon-gug-ui Jeong-gyo"** (천국의 정교), an unrecognized "Orthodox" cult active during the Korean War. 

The cult was founded by **Kim Dae-sun**, a high-ranking intellectual of the *Workers' Party of South Korea* (WPSK). Officially, Kim was executed in 1953 for "espionage and collaboration with the North." However, Bureau documents suggest he was actually attempting to create a "Shared Consciousness" through a ritualistic blend of Marxist dialectics and forbidden Orthodox mysticism.

## 2. THE CULT & THE TRAGEDY
* **The Doctrine:** The cult believed that the "true" revolution could only happen in the afterlife. They sought to detach their souls from the physical world to form a "Utopian Collective" in the spectral plane.
* **The Massacre:** In June 1953, sixty-four members were found dead in an underground bunker. While the authorities claimed it was a mass suicide, forensic spectral analysis shows that the wounds were consistent with **"internal tearing"**—as if their souls were forcibly ripped out while they were trying to flee the ritual site.
* **The Escapees:** It is now known that several members tried to abandon the cult when Kim Dae-sun’s rituals began to summon "things" from the void. These members are the primary haunting entities today.

## 3. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **The Red Radio:** Manifestations often begin with an old shortwave radio broadcast. A voice (believed to be Kim Dae-sun) reads names from a list of "traitors." Anyone who hears their own name will experience a sudden loss of identity and a compulsion to walk toward the nearest dark basement.
* **The "Defector" Ghosts:** The entities haunting the sites are not Kim Dae-sun, but the terrified spirits of the members who tried to run. They appear with their mouths sewn shut with iron wire, a punishment for "speaking against the Collective."
* **Shadow Borders:** Areas affected by Subject-006 often display a "Border Effect" where the floor is divided by a red line. Crossing this line causes immediate auditory hallucinations of heavy artillery and whispering voices in archaic Korean dialects.

## 4. INCIDENT LOG
- **1953-07-10:** Recovery of the "Hwang-nam Tapes." These recordings contain the final moments of the cult. The screams heard on the tape are not human.
- **1988-09-17:** During the Seoul Olympics, a construction crew unearthed a hidden altar. Three workers were found later staring at a blank wall, reciting the WPSK manifesto in perfect unison for 48 hours.
- **2013-02-14:** A viral video in South Korea showed a "shadow figure" in a Hanbok appearing behind a K-Pop idol during a live stream. The figure was identified as a cult member missing since 1952.

## 5. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
* **Information Suppression:** Any mention of the "Cheon-gug-ui Jeong-gyo" in historical archives must be redacted or attributed to North Korean propaganda.
* **Signal Jamming:** Bureau assets monitor South Korean airwaves for unauthorized shortwave broadcasts.
* **Artifact Retrieval:** The "Altar of the Collective" is currently kept in a high-security vacuum chamber at Site-82.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *Kim Dae-sun wasn't just a communist or a priest. He was a door-opener. The members who tried to escape weren't running from the law; they were running from what was coming through the door he opened. The "Utopia" he promised is a hungry place.*
