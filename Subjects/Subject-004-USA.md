**STATUS:** UNCONTAINED / SECTOR SEALED
**THREAT LEVEL:** CLASS-V (SPECTRAL AGGRESSION)
**FIRST RECORDED:** 1989, Gary, Indiana, USA

## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-004-USA refers to the "Redwood Corporate Plaza," an 8-story brutalist office complex that served as the secret headquarters for the *Aetheric Research Group (ARG)* until their sudden dissolution in 1989. 

The building is physically decaying, but its internal systems (lights, elevators, computers) continue to operate sporadically without a power source. The site is haunted by "The Staff"—a collective of spectral entities dressed in scorched 1980s business attire.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **The Overtime Protocol:** Any human entering the building after 6:00 PM local time becomes subject to "The Shift." All exits vanish and are replaced by infinite cubicle rows. The subject feels an overwhelming psychological urge to sit at a desk and begin typing on non-functional keyboards.
* **The CEO (Subject-004-A):** A massive, shadowy entity residing in the penthouse office. It is composed of magnetic tape from thousands of destroyed VHS cassettes. It does not speak but emits a high-pitched mechanical screech that causes permanent hearing loss.
* **Temporal Leakage:** Documents found within the building often describe events that have not yet occurred, or "alternative" history where the Bureau was never formed.

## 3. INCIDENT LOG
- **1989-10-14:** The ARG headquarters goes dark. Local police find the building empty, but all coffee mugs were still steaming hot. No bodies were ever recovered.
- **2002-05-20:** Urban explorers entered the 3rd floor. One survivor was found three days later inside a sealed ventilation duct, claiming the "Manager" wanted to review his performance.
- **2013-11-11:** Bureau cleanup crews attempted to recover the ARG Mainframe. They were forced to retreat when the elevators began opening into a void filled with human eyes.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
The site is designated as a **Permanent Exclusion Zone**.
* **Physical Barrier:** A 4-meter high concrete wall has been erected around the plaza. 
* **Acoustic Dampening:** High-powered speakers play white noise 24/7 to drown out the "screech" from the penthouse.
* **Counter-Intrusion:** Any individual seen attempting to enter the building is to be detained and administered Class-B Amnestics. Under no circumstances should any personnel answer the ringing payphones near the entrance.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *The ARG didn't go bankrupt. They were "acquired." We still don't know who or what signed the merger papers found in the lobby. Whatever is running that building now is still hiring.*
