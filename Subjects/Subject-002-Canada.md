# SUBJECT REPORT: 002-CANADA

**STATUS:** SECURED / UNDER OBSERVATION
**THREAT LEVEL:** CLASS-VI (SPATIAL ANOMALY)
**FIRST RECORDED:** 2008, Northern Ontario, Canada

---

## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-002-Canada refers to a two-story wooden cabin located deep within the Boreal Forest of Ontario. While the exterior appears as a standard 1970s-era logging cabin, the interior space is **non-Euclidean**.

Once an individual enters the front door, the internal dimensions expand infinitely. GPS tracking fails immediately upon entry, and the interior layout consists of an endless corridor of identical pine-paneled rooms.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **Spatial Distortion:** The distance between two rooms can change while walking. A subject may walk five meters forward but find themselves kilometers away from the exit.
* **The "Frost" Entity:** Inhabitants report a drop in temperature to -40°C whenever they feel "watched." Thermal imaging has captured a tall, translucent silhouette that mimics the breathing patterns of the observer.
* **Organic Integration:** Objects left inside the cabin for more than 48 hours begin to grow a thin layer of organic pine-like tissue, eventually becoming part of the structure itself.

## 3. INCIDENT LOG
- **2008-11-04:** A group of five hunters entered the cabin seeking shelter from a blizzard. Only one emerged three weeks later, suffering from severe frostbite and claiming he had walked "hundreds of miles" inside the house.
- **2015-02-12:** Bureau drones were sent inside. The video feed lasted for 12 hours, showing nothing but empty rooms before a pale hand covered the camera lens.
- **2024-PRESENT:** The site is surrounded by a "Government Research" fence. No civilian access is permitted.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
The cabin is currently contained by **Outpost-12**. 
* **Entrance Control:** The front door must remain padlocked with a triple-redundant magnetic seal.
* **Audio Monitoring:** Contact microphones are placed on the exterior walls. If scratching sounds are heard from the inside, the Outpost must enter 'Silent Protocol'.
* **Exploration:** No further manned explorations are authorized by the Board of Archivists.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *The cabin isn't just a house. It's a digestive system. Every room you pass through is another stage of the process. Do not enter, even if you hear voices calling for help from the windows.*
