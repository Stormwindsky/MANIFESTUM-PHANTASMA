## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-003-Japan is a generic, unbranded 14-inch CRT television set manufactured circa 1998. It was discovered in a small electronics recycling shop after three successive owners were reported missing.

The device functions without being plugged into a power source. It does not receive standard broadcast signals; instead, it displays a continuous, high-definition feed of a static-filled hallway that appears to be part of an unidentified hospital basement.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **Selective Transmission:** The "hallway" displayed on the screen changes based on the viewer's heartbeat. If the viewer's heart rate exceeds 100 BPM, a figure (Subject-003-A) begins to appear at the far end of the hallway.
* **Trans-Media Manifestation:** Subject-003-A is a tall, faceless entity wearing a blood-stained lab coat. When the entity reaches the "front" of the screen, the glass of the CRT becomes permeable, allowing the entity to physically pull objects or persons into the broadcast.
* **The "Static" Virus:** Digital photographs taken of Subject-003-Japan become corrupted over time, with the pixels rearranging themselves to form Japanese kanji for "HELP" and "STAY AWAY".

## 3. RECOVERY LOG
- **2011-03-15:** Tokyo Metropolitan Police investigate a "disappearing room" incident. Subject-003-Japan was found active in an empty apartment.
- **2012-08-22:** Bureau agents successfully neutralized the shop owner who was attempting to "feed" stray animals to the television.
- **2013-05-10:** Dr. Arisawa attempted to record the audio. The recording only contained the sound of a woman whispering the names of the agent's deceased relatives.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
Subject-003-Japan is stored in a lead-lined vault at **Site-04 (Japan Sector)**.
* **Visual Shielding:** The screen must be covered with a heavy black shroud at all times when not under testing.
* **Power Isolation:** No electrical outlets are permitted within the containment cell to prevent potential "bleeding" of the entity into the local power grid.
* **Personnel:** Any staff with a history of heart conditions or anxiety are strictly prohibited from entering the containment zone.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *We don't know where the hallway leads. One drone sent inside the screen traveled for 40 kilometers through identical corridors before the signal was cut. It's not a hospital. It's an endless architecture.*
