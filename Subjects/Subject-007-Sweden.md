# SUBJECT REPORT: 007-SWEDEN

**STATUS:** CONTAINED / MUSEUM EXHIBIT
**THREAT LEVEL:** CLASS-V (QUANTUM AGGRESSION)
**FIRST RECORDED:** 1922, Stockholm, Sweden

## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-007-Sweden consists of a set of three (3) distinct plate armors dating from the late 15th century. They were recovered from the private collection of a deceased Swedish nobleman who claimed they were "guardians of the northern lights."

The armors are designated as follows:
* **Subject-007-A:** Wears a commander's harness, wielding a **Quantum Greatsword**.
* **Subject-007-B & C:** Wielding early-model **matchlock arquebuses** (primitive war rifles) modified with unidentified glowing etchings.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **Quantum Locking:** The entities are "statues" as long as they are being observed by a human eye or a live camera feed. If the line of sight is broken (even by a blink), they can move instantly to any point within a 20-meter radius.
* **Nocturnal Activation:** These properties only manifest between the hours of **sunset and sunrise**. During the day, they are inert pieces of steel.
* **The Quantum Greatsword:** Subject-007-A's sword does not cut through matter; it vibrates at a frequency that de-materializes the molecular bonds of the target.
* **The Arquebuses:** Subjects 007-B and C do not use gunpowder. They fire concentrated bursts of "static light" that bypass modern ballistic vests.

## 3. INCIDENT LOG
- **1922-11-12:** A night watchman at the Stockholm Historical Museum was found "fused" into a stone wall. The armors were found back on their pedestals, but in different poses.
- **1950-06-05:** During a power failure, Subject-007-A breached its display case and neutralized an entire security team. One survivor reported that the armor "doesn't move, it simply teleports between blinks."
- **2013-08-19:** A Bureau researcher attempted to weld the joints of the armor. The welding equipment failed simultaneously as the sun set. The researcher was found locked inside the chest piece of 007-B.

## 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
The subjects are currently held at the **Nordic Bureau Wing (Site-09)**.
* **Redundant Observation:** The containment room is equipped with twenty-four (24) high-speed cameras, staggered so that their shutter cycles never overlap. At least two cameras must be active at all times.
* **Light Saturation:** The room is flooded with 10,000 lumens of artificial sunlight during the night to trick the armors' "activation clock." However, this has only been 40% effective.
* **The "Blink" Rule:** Personnel entering the room must use "The Eye-Stitch Method" (blinking one eye at a time) to ensure constant visual contact.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *The weapons they carry are far too advanced for the Middle Ages. Our theory is that the armors aren't haunted by ghosts, but by 'soldiers from a future that failed to happen.' They aren't trying to kill us; they are still fighting a war we don't understand.*
