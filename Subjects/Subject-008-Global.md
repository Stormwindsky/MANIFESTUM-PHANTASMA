## 1. DESCRIPTION
Subject-008 refers to an unauthorized television channel titled **"CHANNEL ZERO-X"** (also known as *The Hollow Network*). It first appeared in 1995 on analog frequencies during a major storm in London. 

Unlike standard channels, Channel Zero-X does not have a physical headquarters or satellite source. It is an "opportunistic" signal that piggybacks on existing frequencies. Access is extremely rare; it is estimated that only 0.0001% of television sets globally are capable of receiving the signal at any given time.

## 2. ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES
* **Selective Tuning:** The channel cannot be found by "scanning." It only appears when a viewer is in a state of extreme isolation, typically between 03:00 and 04:00 AM.
* **The "Void" Content:** The programming consists of high-quality footage of places that do not exist: cities with impossible architecture, forests where the trees are made of bone, and "live" talk shows where the hosts have no facial features.
* **The Calling Effect:** Viewers who watch the channel for more than 15 minutes report a "pulling" sensation. In 12% of recorded cases, the viewer has disappeared from their home, leaving behind only a pile of static-charged clothes in front of the TV.

## 3. HISTORICAL TIMELINE
- **1995-07-14:** First known victim, a 19-year-old student in London. His VCR was found still recording. The tape showed 4 hours of a single, unmoving door with "HIS NAME" written on it in blood.
- **2003-11-20:** During the digital transition, the Bureau feared the signal would die. Instead, it evolved. It began appearing on digital cable boxes and even encrypted military monitors.
- **2013-05-05:** A major incident in a small town in Ohio where 40 households simultaneously tuned into Channel Zero-X. The entire neighborhood was found in a state of catatonic shock the next morning.

## 4. PROGRAMMING EXAMPLES
* **"The Weather for Nowhere":** A 24-hour weather map of a planet that looks like Earth but with "Black Rain" and "Screaming Wind" warnings.
* **"Children's Hour":** A puppet show where the puppets explain how to "unlink" your soul from your body.
* **"The Static Gallery":** Just 30 minutes of static, but if you stare closely, you can see your own death in the pixels.

## 5. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL
Since the Bureau cannot "turn off" the signal, the focus is on **Detection and Suppression**.
* **Global Monitoring:** Bureau listening posts scan for the "Zero-X Signature" (a 14.4 Hz sub-frequency). 
* **The "Black-Out" Script:** When a broadcast is detected, the Bureau triggers a localized power outage to save potential viewers.
* **Public Warning:** The official cover story for these outages is "Aging Infrastructure" or "Solar Flares."

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *Channel Zero-X is not a haunting. It is a recruitment tool. It’s looking for people who are 'disconnected' from reality so it can pull them into its own network. If you see a channel with no logo and a black sun in the corner: **UNPLUG THE TELEVISION IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT WAIT TO TURN IT OFF WITH THE REMOTE.***
